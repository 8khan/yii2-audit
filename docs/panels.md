# Panel Documentation

Panels are classes that are responsible for capturing and displaying data.  A panel is displayed within an entry.  An entry represents a single hit to your application (via an web or console entry script, eg `web/index.php` or `yii`).

In this section you will find documentation regarding the core audit panels as well as how to create your own panels.
